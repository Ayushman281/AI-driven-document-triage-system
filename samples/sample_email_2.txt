Subject: RE: Ticket #45921 - Account Access Issue

Hello Michael,

Thank you for contacting Cloud Services Support. I understand you're experiencing difficulty accessing your account after the recent password reset.

I've looked into your account and noticed that there were multiple unsuccessful login attempts before the system temporarily locked your account as a security measure. This is a standard security protocol to protect your data.

I've reset the security lock on your account. Please follow these steps to regain access:

1. Go to https://cloudservices.com/reset
2. Enter your email address: michael.wong@gmail.com
3. Click "Send reset link"
4. Check your email for our message (check spam folder if needed)
5. Follow the link in the email to create a new password

For added security, please consider enabling two-factor authentication after logging in.

If you continue to experience issues, please reply to this email or call our support line at 1-888-555-6789. Our team is available 24/7.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
